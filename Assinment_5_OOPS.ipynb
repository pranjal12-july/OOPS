        "What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. It focuses on four main principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. OOP allows for better code organization, reusability, and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2.\n",
        " What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Answer:\n",
        " A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3.\n",
        " What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Answer:\n",
        " An object is an instance of a class. It contains the attributes and behaviors defined by the class.\n",

        "Question 4.\n",
        " What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        " Answer:\n",
        " Abstraction: Hides unnecessary details and only shows relevant data to the user. Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to an object's data and methods, bundling attributes with methods that operate on them. Achieved using access modifiers like _ (protected) and __ (private).\n",

        "\n",
        "  Answer:\n",
        "  Dunder (Double Under) methods, also called magic methods, start and end with __. They provide special behaviors to Python objects.\n",

        " Question 10.\n",

        " Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is known as the destructor. It’s called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when its reference count reaches zero).\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",

        "\n",
        " Question 24.\n",
        "What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
